# Company Data Collection and Analysis

## Topic Overview
This project retrieves and processes company data using web scraping techniques. The script is designed to navigate through multiple pages to collect company-specific information, which is then stored in a Pandas DataFrame for analysis. This data can be leveraged for various purposes such as company comparisons, job market analysis, or trend observations within the business landscape.

## Description
The script sends HTTP requests to the AmbitionBox website, retrieves data from multiple pages, and parses the HTML content to extract relevant information about companies. The project captures the following data fields for each company:

- **Name**: The name of the company.
- **Rating**: The average company rating.
- **Company Type**: The type of company (e.g., public, private).
- **Jobs**: The number of available job postings.
- **Reviews**: The number of reviews given by employees.
- **Locations**: The locations where the company operates.

This data can be used for various analyses, such as examining company trends, creating visualizations of popular job locations, or studying ratings across different types of companies.
